> Every lab you turn in will have a README.md file. This file will contain a running work log of everything you did for this lab. I especially want to know where you got stuck along the way and what you did to get out of being stuck. One to two sentences isnâ€™t going to cut it here: this is the only opportunity you are going to get to document your own progression so take it seriously. At the end of the semester, I should be able to read through all the README.md files and have a good idea of your growth--as should you!



I spent a lot of time working on the backend and connecting everything togther. I essentially rewrote everything for this lab except for the d3 files and (some of) the backend, which I just copied from previous labs with some minor revisions. I did spend a good deal of time on fixing lots of bugs and probably missing even more.

I finally was able to rewrite the main part of my code with buliding the song cards and whatnot in a more angular-friendly format with *ngFor iterating over an array instead of building raw html.
